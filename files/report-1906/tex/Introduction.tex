\section{Introduction}
This report refers to the project regarding the simulation of Lévy process $\left\{X_{t}\right\}_{t \geq 0}$. The project description is provided by Nicolai:
\blockquote{The Lévy process is a continuous-time stochastic process with independent, stationary increments: it represents the motion of a point whose successive displacements are random and independent, and statistically identical over different time intervals of the same length.The project used a subclass of Lévy process, which is the Brownian motion process with jumps that occur at random time points.\cite{Brownian}}

Requirements decomposition:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulate a discrete 3-coordinate discrete stochastic process $\left\{\left(P_{i}, A_{i}, M_{i}\right)\right\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $\left\{X_{t}\right\}_{t \geq 0}$.
\item Explanation of the algorithm.
\item Experimentation with different parameters $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\lambda$.
\item Experimentation with various $Y_i$ functions, such as Exponential, Erlang, Hyperexponential and Pareto distributions.
\item Estimation of first passage probabilities $\mathbb{P}\left(\sup _{t \geq 0} X_{t}>a\right)$ for different level of $a$. 
\end{enumerate}
