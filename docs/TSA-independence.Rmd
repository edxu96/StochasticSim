## Test for Dependence

> One must always remember that an apparent problem, such as residual autocorrelation, could have other causes than error autocorrelation, so it is worth investigating alternative sources, such as incorrect functional form, or parameter non-constancy (discussed in section \@ref(constancy)).

### Improve the Model

> A failure of a test for temporal independence of the innovations can often be remedied by reconsidering the specification of the model. [@hendry2007econometric]
