Welcome to the StochasticSim wiki!

## Problems to be Solved

- [x] Exercise 8, `median` result is not perfect.
- [x] Exercise 4, simulated result
- [x] Exercise 3, confidence interval
- [ ] Exercise 3, Chi-Square test of CDF


1. ~~Simulation and estimation in a Markov model of breast cancer (discrete event)~~

2. Simulation of Levy processes (discrete event)
Nicolai: nisi@dtu.dk

3. Simulation of micro-emulsions (MCMC)
Jakob: s134265@student.dtu.dk

4. Simulation of queues with Brownian motion input (discrete event, can be developed to something more advanced)
Nicolai: nisi@dtu.dk

5. ~~Generic exercise: Simulation of post office~~, ambiguous

6. ~~Superposition of interrupted Poisson processes~~, ambiguous

7. ~~Simulation of system with trunk reservation. (Motivation slightly outdated, but the projects itself is still nice)~~, ambiguous
